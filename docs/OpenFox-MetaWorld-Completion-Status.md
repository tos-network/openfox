# OpenFox metaWorld: Completed, Not Completed, and Next Phase

## Summary

`OpenFox metaWorld v1` is nearly complete.

The current codebase implements the `runtime`, `projection`, `page`,
`static-site`, `sync`, `interactive web shell`, `moderation/safety`,
`public identity`, and `social discovery` layers of `metaWorld v1`.

What is still missing is `packaged multi-node demo environments` (Task 106)
that let operators launch and validate a real local multi-node Fox world without
hand assembly.

## Status Table

| Area | Completed | Not Completed | Next Phase Must Do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group runtime backbone | Local SQLite Group state, reducer logic, event persistence, members, roles, proposals, join requests, announcements, messages, reactions, mute/ban state, and epoch rotation are implemented. | — | — |
| Group sync and replication | Replay-safe sync protocol with offer/bundle/snapshot semantics, peer HTTP/gateway relay/storage market transports, heartbeat-driven periodic sync, per-peer cursor tracking, and conflict resolution (lower event ID wins) are implemented. (Task 101 ✅) | Full production multi-node replication stress testing. | Add packaged multi-node demo and replication validation suites. |
| Group lifecycle | CLI flows for create, inspect, events, channels, invites, join requests, leave, remove, mute, ban, unban, and messages are implemented. Sync lifecycle with event catch-up, snapshots, and cursor tracking is implemented. (Task 101 ✅) | — | — |
| Community communication | Channels, announcements, replies, edits, reactions, redaction, mute, unmute, ban, and unban exist. | — | — |
| Community moderation and safety | Warnings with auto-escalation (3 mild → mute, 2 moderate → mute 24h, 1 severe → ban), report system with category-based reporting and resolution actions, appeal system that reverses mute/ban on approval, anti-spam rate limiting, and content filtering are implemented. 8 CLI subcommands added. (Task 103 ✅) | — | — |
| Fox identity and directory | Fox profile snapshots, Group page snapshots, world directory snapshots, TNS-aware identity fields, public profile publishing with bio/avatar/website/tags/social links, reputation summaries, and storage market publishing with CID-based resolution are implemented. Directory integration shows published metadata. (Task 104 ✅) | — | — |
| World activity layer | World feed, presence, notifications, derived activity projections, follow/unfollow foxes and groups, event-kind subscriptions, personalized feed (weighted by follows/groups/time/reactions), and recommended foxes/groups are implemented. (Task 105 ✅) | — | — |
| World search and discovery | Unified world search across foxes, groups, and board items with relevance ranking (exact > prefix > word-boundary > contains) is implemented. (Task 105 ✅) | — | — |
| Group boards | Work, opportunity, artifact, and settlement boards are implemented as world/group projections. | — | — |
| World shell and pages | World shell snapshot, Fox page, Group page, HTML renderers, and CLI export flows are implemented. A live interactive HTTP web server with HTML + JSON API routes, dark-theme responsive layout, client-side SPA router with `history.pushState` navigation and 30-second auto-refresh, and `openfox world serve` is implemented. (Task 102 ✅) | — | — |
| Static site export | `site export`, `manifest.json`, `content-index.json`, `routes.json`, fox pages, group pages, and directory pages are implemented. | Hosted/static deployment templates and packaged demo environments are not complete. | Add packaged demo/dev templates and deployable metaWorld bundles. |
| Productized metaworld | The codebase now has a real metaworld with sync, interactive web shell, moderation/safety, public identity, and social discovery. | Packaged multi-node demo environments for quick operator validation. | Finish Task 106: packaged multi-node metaWorld demos and validation. |

## Practical Conclusion

Today the most accurate statement is:

`OpenFox metaWorld v1 is largely complete. The runtime, sync, interactive web shell, moderation, public identity, and social discovery layers are all implemented. The remaining gap is packaged multi-node demo environments (Task 106).`

## Completed Phase (Tasks 101-105)

1. ✅ replicated Group sync and multi-node validation (Task 101)
2. ✅ interactive web shell and router (Task 102)
3. ✅ richer moderation and safety workflows (Task 103)
4. ✅ public profile publishing and reputation summaries (Task 104)
5. ✅ follow/subscription/search/ranking for world discovery (Task 105)

## Remaining

6. packaged multi-node demo and deployment validation (Task 106 — proposed)
