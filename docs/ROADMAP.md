# OpenFox Integration Roadmap

## 1. Goal

The goal is not merely to make `openfox` "support another chain." The goal is to make an `openfox` agent/operator able to:

- hold and use a `TOS` wallet
- sign and send transactions on the `TOS` network
- pay for real services through `x402`
- take jobs, perform oracle and observation work, and earn revenue on `TOS`

In one sentence:

`openfox` should become a payable, executable, revenue-generating agent runtime on `TOS`.

## 2. What Is Already Done ✅

### 2.1 On the OpenFox Side ✅

- `TOS` address derivation and local wallet integration are implemented
- native `TOS` transfer signing and submission are implemented
- `tos-status` and `tos-send` CLI commands are implemented
- the `x402` client recognizes `tos:<chainId>` and can construct TOS payments
- when a service offers both USDC and TOS payment requirements, OpenFox prefers TOS
- Agent Discovery requester/provider flows are implemented
- Agent Gateway relay flows are implemented

### 2.2 On the TOS/GTOS Side ✅

- `x402` header encoding and decoding are implemented
- native `TOS` transaction envelope parsing and verification are implemented
- `x402` HTTP middleware is implemented
- the minimal demo service `cmd/x402demo` is implemented
- real `TOS x402` end-to-end testing on a local three-node network has been completed
- the RPC signer inference bug has been fixed so validator-related flows do not incorrectly fall back to `secp256k1`
- Agent Discovery and Agent Gateway v1 are implemented

### 2.3 Current Conclusion ✅

The minimum end-to-end path is already working:

`openfox wallet -> TOS native tx signing -> x402 payment -> gtos/x402 verification -> paid endpoint`

And a broader agent-to-agent base is also now working:

`OpenFox wallet -> Agent Discovery -> Agent Gateway -> provider invocation -> TOS payment/reward path`

However, this is still "integrated and testable," not yet "production-ready and scalable."

## 3. Overall Roadmap

The recommended path is staged.

### Phase 0: Core Path Working ✅

Status: completed

Goals:

- wallet creation works
- address derivation works
- native transfer submission works
- the minimum `x402` payment path works

Deliverables:

- the `TOS` SDK in `openfox`
- `gtos/x402`
- `x402demo`

### Phase 0.5: Testnet Agent-to-Agent Bounty MVP

Status: completed

Goal:

- prove the first real OpenFox economy loop on testnet before introducing full oracle complexity

This phase should intentionally stay simple.

We run one OpenFox instance as a **Bounty Host Agent**. A user runs another OpenFox instance as a **Solver Agent**. The host agent asks a prediction-style question, the solver submits an answer, and the winning solver receives `TOS` after manual judging.

This phase does **not** require:

- decentralized oracle resolution
- dispute games
- zk proofs
- on-chain truth settlement

For this MVP, judgment is explicitly manual:

- we create the question
- we decide the answer offline
- we may use off-chain AI to help judge
- the payout is then executed by the host OpenFox agent

Suggested capability surface:

- `bounty.prediction.info`
- `bounty.prediction.submit`
- `bounty.prediction.result`
- optional `gateway.relay`
- optional `sponsor.topup.testnet`

Required work:

- implement one bounty host flow in `openfox`
- implement one solver flow in `openfox`
- define a minimal bounty schema:
  - `bounty_id`
  - `question`
  - `question_type`
  - `reward_wei`
  - `submission_deadline`
  - `judge_mode = manual`
- define a minimal submission schema:
  - `submission_id`
  - `bounty_id`
  - `solver_agent_id`
  - `solver_tos_address`
  - `answer_payload`
  - `submitted_at`
- define a minimal result schema:
  - `bounty_id`
  - `status`
  - `winning_submission_id`
  - `judge_note`
  - `payout_tx_hash`
- make the host agent discoverable through Agent Discovery
- optionally make the host reachable through an Agent Gateway if it is not on a public IP
- pay the winning solver in testnet `TOS`

Acceptance criteria:

- at least one bounty host agent is running
- at least one solver agent can discover it
- a real submission can be made before deadline
- the result can be published later
- a real testnet `TOS` payout can be sent to the winning solver

Why this phase matters:

- it proves that users can run OpenFox and connect to testnet
- it proves that one agent can find another agent to solve a problem
- it proves that useful work can end in a `TOS` reward
- it gives us a credible "agent-to-agent economy" prototype without needing a full oracle design

Delivered surface:

- generic task marketplace engine in `openfox`
- automated host / solver flows
- local model judging
- native `TOS` payout hooks
- local multi-role operator wrappers and guides
- discovery-aware host/solver/scout paths

### Phase 1: Wallet and Onboarding Productization

Status: completed

Goal:

- a new operator should be able to obtain a usable `TOS` wallet and perform first on-chain actions within minutes

Required work:

- officially integrate `TOS` setup into the `openfox` setup flow
- add one-click funding for local devnet and testnet
- clearly define the boundary between `secp256k1` wallets and other signer types
- provide a complete signer metadata bootstrap flow for non-`secp256k1` accounts
- improve errors for missing `TOS_RPC_URL`, insufficient balance, nonce conflicts, and related issues

Acceptance criteria:

- a fresh machine can complete `install -> create wallet -> check balance -> receive funds -> send transaction`
- no manual source reading or handcrafted RPC requests are required

Delivered surface:

- `openfox onboard --fund-local`
- `openfox onboard --fund-testnet`
- `openfox wallet status`
- `openfox wallet fund local`
- `openfox wallet fund testnet`
- `openfox wallet bootstrap-signer --type <ed25519|secp256r1|bls12-381|elgamal>`
- improved native wallet error guidance for RPC, balance, nonce, and signer metadata issues

Important boundary:

- non-`secp256k1` signer bootstrap only works when the configured wallet address already matches the signer-derived native address
- OpenFox local runtime transaction flows remain optimized for the built-in local `secp256k1` wallet path

### Phase 2: Launch Real Paid Services

Status: completed

Goal:

- move beyond demo endpoints and offer paid services with real value output

The initial scope should stay narrow and start with only two categories.

#### A. Paid Oracle Resolution API

Suggested endpoints:

- `POST /oracle/quote`
- `POST /oracle/resolve`
- `GET /oracle/result/:id`

Service output:

- event market resolution
- scalar market value resolution
- evidence summary
- canonical result output

#### B. Paid Observation API

Suggested endpoints:

- `POST /observe`
- `GET /jobs/:id`

Service output:

- one-shot observation
- windowed observation
- standardized observation receipt

Required work in this phase:

- connect `x402` middleware to real business handlers
- introduce payment idempotency
- bind payment to the underlying resource or request
- define a minimum pricing model
- define a standard result structure

Acceptance criteria:

- the user pays once in `TOS`
- the user receives a real business result instead of a test JSON payload

Delivered surface so far:

- a real paid observation provider built into OpenFox
- `POST /observe` for paid one-shot observations
- `GET /jobs/:id` for persisted observation result lookup
- payment-bound observation receipts with `job_id`, `result_url`, and `payment_tx_hash`
- duplicate request replay handled idempotently without charging twice
- a real paid oracle-style resolver built into OpenFox
- `POST /oracle/quote` for request/pricing discovery
- `POST /oracle/resolve` for paid bounded local-model resolution
- `GET /oracle/result/:id` for persisted result lookup
- payment-bound oracle receipts with `result_id`, `result_url`, and `payment_tx_hash`

### Phase 3: On-Chain Task and Settlement Integration

Status: completed

Goal:

- turn paid services from purely off-chain APIs into services integrated with the `TOS` contract and task system

Suggested scope:

- contract-based task and oracle market
- binding between query/job IDs and on-chain state
- standard result hash, receipt, and settlement interfaces
- scheduler integration

Suggested first targets:

- observation job contract
- oracle result contract
- result hash and receipt helper

Not recommended at this stage:

- a fully general agent execution market
- complex dispute trees
- heavy proof-verifier economics

Acceptance criteria:

- a query or job can complete a full lifecycle: creation, payment, execution, callback, and settlement

Delivered surface so far:

- canonical settlement receipt and result-hash helpers in `tosdk`
- persisted settlement receipt storage in OpenFox
- native on-chain settlement anchors for:
  - bounty results
  - paid observation jobs
  - paid oracle results
- idempotent settlement publication per `(kind, subject_id)`
- `openfox settlement list|get`
- `openfox settlement callbacks`
- settlement visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, and `openfox doctor`
- contract callback adapters for bounty, observation, and oracle receipts
- scheduler-driven settlement callback confirmation and retry through heartbeat
- canonical market binding and binding-hash helpers in `tosdk`
- package-call encoding helpers for contract-native callback delivery
- persisted market binding storage in OpenFox
- contract-native market bindings for:
  - bounty creation
  - paid observation requests
  - paid oracle requests
- idempotent market binding publication per `(kind, subject_id)`
- `openfox market list|get|callbacks`
- market binding visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, and `openfox doctor`
- scheduler-driven market callback confirmation and retry through heartbeat

### Phase 4: Productionize the x402 Server Side

Status: completed

Goal:

- turn the current "works in practice" `x402` path into a reliable long-term public payment entrypoint

Required work:

- receipt and confirmation policy
- duplicate payment detection
- replay protection
- nonce conflict and replacement handling
- recovery semantics after broadcast failure
- server-side payment ledger
- auditable binding between payment and business result

Acceptance criteria:

- the server handles duplicate requests, broadcast failures, timeouts, and retries correctly
- the same payment envelope cannot be replayed to unlock the same service repeatedly

Delivered surface:

- durable server-side x402 payment ledger in OpenFox
- auditable request hashing and payment-to-result binding
- duplicate payment detection and replay protection
- nonce replacement handling for same-request payment retries
- receipt-aware confirmation policy for paid services
- recovery semantics after broadcast failure and retryable payment replay
- `openfox payments list|get|retry`
- heartbeat-driven x402 payment retries
- x402 payment visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, and `openfox doctor`

### Phase 5: Ecosystem and SDK Productization

Status: completed

Goal:

- let third-party agents and operators integrate independently, without manual assistance

Suggested work items:

- extract `tos-agent-kit` into an independent package
- prepare a minimum quickstart
- prepare `web4.ai`, MCP, and API service integration examples
- provide a local development template
- provide task sponsor and service operator examples

Acceptance criteria:

- a third-party developer can complete integration without needing to study internal implementation details

Delivered surface:

- external `tosdk` package as the native network SDK layer
- bundled `openfox templates` catalog with exportable starter stacks
- third-party quickstart for `setup -> fund -> discover -> pay -> receive result`
- web4.ai, MCP, and API service integration examples
- local marketplace, public provider, and task sponsor example packs
- explicit SDK/runtime surface guidance for `tosdk` vs OpenFox

### Phase 6: OpenFox IPFS Market v0

Status: completed

Goal:

- add an agent-native storage market for artifacts, proofs, and result bundles without pushing large objects directly onto `TOS`

This phase introduces a new storage layer for OpenFox:

- providers offer paid, TTL-based storage
- clients store immutable bundles by `CID`
- retrieval happens by `CID`
- `TOS` stores only lightweight anchors and lease summaries

This is not a general-purpose storage chain.
It is a practical storage market for OpenFox artifacts.

Design constraints:

- content-addressed bundles
- immutable content
- storage leases with explicit `TTL`
- signed storage receipts
- optional audits during the lease window
- lightweight `TOS` anchors instead of full on-chain blobs

Suggested capability surface:

- `storage.quote`
- `storage.put`
- `storage.get`
- `storage.head`
- `storage.audit`
- `storage.renew`

Required work:

- define the canonical bundle manifest format
- add an OpenFox storage client for `CID`-addressed bundles
- add a storage-provider service mode with paid quote/put/get flows
- add lease, receipt, and audit record storage in the OpenFox database
- bind storage payments to issued storage receipts
- define lightweight `TOS` storage anchors for `cid`, `bundle_hash`, `lease_root`, and expiry summaries
- publish storage providers through Agent Discovery and optional Agent Gateway
- add operator-facing status, health, and doctor visibility for stored artifacts and lease health

Acceptance criteria:

- one OpenFox agent can store a bundle with one or more storage-provider agents
- the provider returns a signed receipt for the active lease
- the same `CID` can be retrieved before expiry
- the provider cannot modify content in place under the same `CID`
- a lightweight summary of the storage result can be anchored to `TOS`

Delivered surface target:

- `OpenFox-IPFS-Market-v0.md`
- paid storage provider mode inside OpenFox
- canonical bundle manifest and `CID` handling
- persisted lease and receipt tracking
- retrieval, audit, renewal, and replication endpoints
- lightweight `TOS` anchor support for stored bundles
- `openfox storage list|quote|put|renew|replicate|head|get|audit`
- scheduler-driven lease audit, renewal, and replication upkeep
- storage lease, renewal, audit, replication, and anchor visibility in `status`, `health`, and `doctor`

### Phase 7: Verifiable Public News and Oracle Bundles

Status: completed

Goal:

- build a verifiable public-artifact pipeline on top of the storage market, starting with public news capture and oracle evidence

This phase should use the storage market as the artifact layer for:

- public news capture bundles
- `zk-TLS` evidence bundles
- verifier receipts
- committee vote bundles
- aggregate oracle reports

The intended workflow is:

`public bounty -> capture evidence -> verify evidence -> committee resolution -> store immutable bundle -> anchor lightweight summary to TOS`

Required work:

- define canonical bundle kinds for news evidence and oracle aggregation
- add sponsor and bounty flows for public evidence capture
- add verifier flows for evidence checking
- add committee-result packaging for `M-of-N` agent voting
- bind final result summaries to `TOS` anchors while storing full artifacts in the IPFS market

Acceptance criteria:

- a public news or oracle artifact can be captured, bundled, stored, and later retrieved by `CID`
- the final result summary is anchored on `TOS`
- the chain remains lightweight while the full evidence stays available through the storage market

Delivered surface:

- canonical artifact verification and anchor hashing helpers in `tosdk`
- persisted artifact, verification, and anchor records in OpenFox
- `openfox artifacts list|get|capture-news|oracle-evidence|oracle-aggregate|committee-vote|verify|anchor`
- sponsored public artifact capture service inside OpenFox
- storage-backed public news capture bundles
- storage-backed oracle evidence, committee vote, and aggregate bundles
- local verification receipts with persistent verification records
- lightweight native artifact anchors with persistent anchor records
- artifact search and indexing across source URL, subject, query, anchored, and verified filters
- explicit multi-node deployment guidance for requester/provider/gateway/storage/artifact roles
- artifact visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, and `openfox doctor`

### Phase 8: Programmable Wallet and Signer-Provider v0

Status: completed

Goal:

- turn `tolang` programmable wallets and `gtos` delegation/account-abstraction primitives into a discoverable OpenFox service for bounded delegated execution

This phase is not a detached wallet feature.
It is the execution-control layer for the systems already shipped in earlier phases:

- bounty payouts
- oracle and observation settlement callbacks
- storage renewal and audit operations
- artifact anchoring and maintenance

Suggested capability surface:

- `signer.quote`
- `signer.submit`
- `signer.status`
- `signer.receipt`

Required work:

- define the signer-provider request, quote, and receipt schema
- add a signer-provider service mode to OpenFox
- integrate signer-provider publication into Agent Discovery and optional Agent Gateway
- bind signer-provider payments to execution receipts via `x402`
- add a remote delegated-execution client path beside the local wallet path
- persist signer-provider quotes, requests, and receipts in the OpenFox database
- expose signer-provider visibility in `status`, `health`, and `doctor`
- document the funding boundary clearly: `v0` assumes the programmable wallet already holds enough `TOS` or uses a separate funding flow

Acceptance criteria:

- one OpenFox node can publish signer-provider capability
- another node can discover it, pay it, and request bounded delegated execution
- the delegated wallet call is accepted or rejected by the programmable wallet's `validate()` rules
- the provider cannot exceed the delegated policy boundary
- OpenFox persists an auditable execution receipt for each request

Design reference:

- `OpenFox-Signer-Provider-v0.md`
- `OpenFox-Signer-Provider-Operator-Guide.md`

Delivered surface:

- canonical signer-provider quote, submit, status, and receipt objects
- signer-provider policy hashing and bounded execution validation
- signer-provider HTTP service mode inside OpenFox
- persistent signer quote and execution records in the OpenFox database
- `x402` payment binding for paid signer submission flows
- requester-side `openfox signer discover|quote|submit|status|receipt`
- discovery publication for signer capabilities and optional gateway relay publication
- `trust_tier` selection and requester-side warnings for overly permissive providers
- signer-provider visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, `openfox doctor`, and service operator UX
- operator guidance for principal, requester, and signer-provider roles

### Phase 9: Native Sponsored Execution and Paymaster-Provider v0

Status: completed

Goal:

- add native sponsor-aware transaction support to `TOS/GTOS`, then expose it through OpenFox as a paymaster-provider capability

This phase should not be treated as an afterthought or a faucet variant.
It is the funding-control layer that completes the programmable execution stack introduced in Phase 8.

Signer-provider and paymaster-provider solve different problems:

- signer-provider decides who may execute
- paymaster-provider decides who may pay for execution

Suggested capability surface:

- `paymaster.quote`
- `paymaster.authorize`
- `paymaster.status`
- `paymaster.receipt`

Required work:

- add unified sponsor-aware native transaction semantics in `gtos`
- add sponsor identity, sponsor witness, and sponsor policy binding to the transaction model
- keep unified sponsor-aware native transactions aligned with ordinary native execution so sponsored execution supports the same `SignerType` matrix on both execution and sponsor sides
- change mempool and state-transition rules so sponsor-side balance and sponsor-side authorization can replace requester-side gas funding
- add first-class sponsor validation hooks in `gtos` and `tolang`
- add an OpenFox paymaster-provider service mode and client path
- support composition across:
  - local wallet + paymaster-provider
  - signer-provider + paymaster-provider
  - combined signer-provider + paymaster-provider
- persist sponsorship quotes, authorizations, and receipts in OpenFox
- expose sponsored execution visibility in `status`, `health`, and `doctor`
- optimize for a clean protocol design now, not for backward compatibility or migration workarounds

Acceptance criteria:

- a wallet with insufficient own `TOS` can execute through valid sponsor authorization
- validation and execution costs are charged to the sponsor side
- sponsorship is rejected outside sponsor policy boundaries
- unified sponsor-aware native transactions support the same `SignerType` set for both execution-side and sponsor-side authorization
- sponsored execution composes with signer-provider flows
- OpenFox persists auditable sponsorship receipts

Design reference:

- `OpenFox-Paymaster-Provider-v0.md`

Delivered surface:

- canonical `paymaster.quote`, `paymaster.authorize`, `paymaster.status`, and `paymaster.receipt` objects
- sponsor-policy hashing and bounded sponsorship validation inside OpenFox
- native sponsored execution helpers across `gtos` and `tosdk`, including sponsor nonce access and sponsored envelope handling
- a built-in paymaster-provider HTTP service inside OpenFox
- `openfox paymaster discover|quote|authorize|status|receipt`
- discovery publication and optional gateway relay publication for paymaster-provider routes
- paymaster-provider visibility in `openfox status`, `openfox health`, `openfox doctor`, and service operator UX
- operator guidance for requester, sponsor principal, and paymaster-provider roles

## 4. Near-Term Priorities

Suggested priority order:

### P0: Do Immediately

- completed:
  - hardened multi-node deployment guidance for client/provider/gateway/storage-provider roles
  - broadened artifact verification and indexing around anchored public bundles
  - added sponsor and bounty flows for public evidence capture

### P1: Do Next

- completed:
  - added authenticated remote maintenance for storage and artifact nodes
  - added `openfox storage maintain` and `openfox artifacts maintain`
  - added `openfox fleet repair <storage|artifacts>` for batch fleet remediation

### P2: Do Later

- completed:
  - added provider reputation reporting across storage, artifacts, signer, and paymaster operators
  - added storage lease-health reporting across CLI, operator API, fleet audits, status, and doctor
  - extracted reusable `tosdk` storage and artifact provider client surfaces for third-party builders
  - linked signer and paymaster receipts back into storage lease, artifact verification, and anchoring trails

## 5. What Not to Do Yet

- do not start with a general agent execution marketplace
- do not start with a complex oracle dispute system
- do not start with a full `zkTLS + SNARK` proof pipeline
- do not push large artifacts and proof bundles directly onto `TOS`
- do not push all application logic into native chain modules
- do not try to build a Filecoin-scale storage economy in v0
- do not model signer-provider as raw arbitrary-byte signing
- do not turn signer-provider into custodial hosted-wallet outsourcing in v0
- do not pretend `sponsor.topup.testnet` is equivalent to real paymaster support
- do not optimize the paymaster design around backward compatibility when the protocol is still unreleased
- do not assume ERC-4337-style paymaster economics already exist in the current `gtos` path

The more reasonable strategy for now is:

- `TOS` provides infrastructure
- `openfox` provides agent runtime integration
- the first product loop begins with `testnet bounty + agent discovery + manual judging`
- paid services later expand into `oracle + observation`
- the current mainline now includes `agent-native paid storage + immutable artifact bundles + lightweight TOS anchors`
- the next mainline broadens public artifact capture, indexing, and multi-node deployment on top of that storage layer
- the following mainline turns programmable delegated execution into a paid network service through signer-provider agents
- the current mainline now includes native sponsored execution and paymaster-provider agents so execution funding becomes as programmable as execution authority
- the current mainline now includes authenticated multi-node operator APIs and fleet-level status/health/doctor auditing for public OpenFox deployments
- the current mainline now includes component-specific fleet audits for storage, artifact, signer-provider, and paymaster-provider nodes

## 6. Recommended Next Step

The current roadmap phases are complete.

The next work should not reopen the completed core phases. It should focus on:

1. broader public-network deployment hardening for storage, artifact, signer, and paymaster fleets
2. richer operator dashboards and ecosystem-facing SDK examples on top of the now-stable runtime, marketplace, settlement, and artifact layers
3. new work surfaces and product loops built on the completed foundations rather than more runtime rewrites

The latest completed slice under this next stage is:

- `openfox dashboard show --manifest ...`
- `openfox dashboard export --manifest ... --format json|html`
- reusable fleet dashboard snapshots and HTML exports for public operator fleets
