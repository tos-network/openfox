# OpenFox Task Overview

This file tracks the runtime refactor priorities that should not get lost while
building OpenFox into a TOS-native agent platform.

## Current Priorities

- [x] Task 1: Rebuild the skills system around a repo-native skill catalog
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Move OpenFox away from inline default skills and direct skill
    instruction injection toward a bundled/managed/workspace skill snapshot model
    inspired by OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 2: Productize heartbeat, cron, and operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the always-on OpenFox runtime, but expose scheduling, status,
    wakeups, and operator controls in a cleaner product surface.
- [x] Task 3: Finish gateway and service operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the existing discovery/gateway protocol line, then improve
    deployment, health checks, service management, and operational examples.
- [x] Task 4: Add managed service install and lifecycle UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make OpenFox easier to run as an always-on user service with
    install/start/stop/restart/uninstall flows closer to OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 5: Add doctor and health diagnostics UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a one-command way to inspect config, wallet,
    inference, RPC, service state, and next-step repair guidance.
- [x] Task 6: Add model/provider status UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make provider readiness visible with an operator command similar to
    OpenClaw's model status surface, without expanding the provider matrix.
- [x] Task 7: Add onboarding command UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Provide an OpenClaw-style onboarding entrypoint that can initialize
    OpenFox and optionally install the managed service in one flow.
- [x] Task 8: Add logs operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a direct way to inspect recent OpenFox runtime logs
    without leaving the CLI.
- [x] Task 9: Add machine-readable runtime status surfaces
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Expose heartbeat, cron, service, gateway, and top-level runtime
    status as stable JSON snapshots for automation, dashboards, and future
    control plane integrations.
- [x] Task 10: Build the first bounty host/solver runtime slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn the bounty architecture into a working bounded-task loop with
    local judging, native payout, HTTP host endpoints, and automated solver
    flows.
- [x] Task 11: Generalize bounty into a task marketplace slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Move beyond a single question-only bounty and support multiple task
    kinds through one reusable engine, HTTP API, CLI surface, and skill-driven
    host/solver flow.
- [x] Task 12: Add non-question task skills
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add bundled task skills beyond the original question flow so OpenFox
    can host and solve translation, social proof, and third-party
    problem-solving work without changing the core engine.
- [x] Task 13: Add third-party problem solving, social bounty, and translation flows
  - Status: Complete

    scout roles instead of relying on ad-hoc shell setup.
- [x] Task 16: Add MVP anti-abuse and policy closure
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add the first production-style guardrails around payouts and solver
    submissions so the marketplace slice is not wide open by default.

  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn the existing `observation.once` provider into a real paid
    service with stable request/result semantics, payment idempotency, and job
    retrieval instead of a one-off test payload flow.
- [x] Task 18: Launch the first paid oracle resolution service
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add a narrow paid oracle-style service on top of the same TOS-native
    runtime base without importing a full decentralized oracle protocol.
- [x] Task 19: Add standard settlement receipts and on-chain anchors

    and local host/solver/scout deployments.
- [x] Task 31: Publish SDK/runtime surface guidance and close Phase 5
  - Status: Complete

    runtime, and close the roadmap’s ecosystem/productization phase.
- [x] Task 32: Implement OpenFox IPFS Market v0
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add an agent-native, paid, immutable, TTL-based storage market for
    bundles and artifacts, with lightweight TOS anchors instead of large
    on-chain blobs.

    and operate through CLI, service surfaces, and persistent indexes.
- [x] Task 36: Add sponsor and bounty flows for public evidence capture
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Support both sponsored capture endpoints and bounty-driven evidence
    capture so OpenFox can gather public news and oracle evidence without
    manual runtime rewrites.
- [x] Task 36A: Add storage lease lifecycle automation
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Extend the first storage market slice with renewal, replication, and
    scheduler-driven lease health maintenance so stored bundles can survive as
    long-lived operator assets.
- [x] Task 37: Define the signer-provider protocol and wallet-policy profile
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn `tolang` programmable-wallet delegation into a stable OpenFox
    network protocol for bounded delegated execution, without falling back to
    custodial hosted-wallet behavior.
- [x] Task 38: Add a signer-provider service mode to OpenFox
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Let one OpenFox node act as a paid signer-provider that accepts
    bounded execution requests, submits them to `TOS`, and returns durable
    execution receipts.
- [x] Task 39: Add requester and remote-execution UX for signer-provider flows
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Let another OpenFox node discover a signer-provider, pay for one
    delegated execution, and use it beside the existing local-wallet path.
- [x] Task 40: Add signer-provider operator visibility, diagnostics, and docs
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make signer-provider state visible through status/health/doctor/docs
    so programmable delegated execution becomes part of the same operator story
    as storage, artifacts, settlement, and paid services.
- [ ] Task 41: Define the paymaster-provider protocol and sponsor-policy profile
  - Status: Planned
  - Goal: Turn native sponsored execution into a stable OpenFox/TOS protocol
    surface for bounded execution funding, without falling back to faucet or
    top-up workarounds.
- [ ] Task 42: Add native sponsored transaction support across GTOS, tolang, and tosdk
  - Status: Planned
  - Goal: Add first-class sponsor-aware transaction semantics, validation, and
    client encoding so sponsor-side gas funding becomes native protocol
    behavior.
- [ ] Task 43: Add a paymaster-provider service mode and requester UX to OpenFox
  - Status: Planned
  - Goal: Let one OpenFox node publish sponsorship capability and let another
    node discover it, obtain one sponsorship authorization, and execute a
    sponsored call through the native TOS path.
- [ ] Task 44: Add paymaster-provider operator visibility, diagnostics, and docs
  - Status: Planned
  - Goal: Make sponsored execution state visible through status/health/doctor,
    service UX, and operator guides so paymaster-provider becomes part of the
    same runtime story as signer-provider and paid services.

- [ ] Keep the protocol explicitly native sponsored execution, not a disguised top-up or faucet path.

## Task 42 Breakdown

- [ ] Add a native sponsored transaction type or equivalent sponsor-aware transaction semantics in `gtos`.
- [ ] Add sponsor identity, sponsor witness, sponsor nonce, sponsor expiry, and sponsor policy-hash fields to the native transaction model.
- [ ] Update mempool and state-transition rules so sponsor-side balance and sponsor-side authorization replace requester-side gas funding.
- [ ] Add first-class sponsor validation hooks in `gtos` and `tolang`.
- [ ] Add `tosdk` encoding, hashing, signing, and client support for native sponsored transactions.
- [ ] Add targeted tests for sponsored validation, replay protection, rejection outside policy, and sponsor-funded execution paths.

## Task 43 Breakdown

- [ ] Add paymaster-provider config and local database tables for sponsorship quotes, authorizations, and receipts.
- [ ] Add a paymaster-provider HTTP service with bounded `quote`, `authorize`, `status`, and `receipt` flows.
- [ ] Reuse the paid-provider pattern so paymaster-provider requests can charge via `x402` when appropriate.
- [ ] Add a requester-side paymaster-provider client that can request a quote and obtain one bounded sponsorship authorization.
- [ ] Add `openfox paymaster ...` CLI surfaces for provider discovery, quote, authorize, and receipt lookup.
- [ ] Support composition across:
  - local wallet + paymaster-provider
  - signer-provider + paymaster-provider
  - combined signer-provider + paymaster-provider
- [ ] Keep discovery-first invocation and optional gateway compatibility for paymaster-provider routes.

## Task 44 Breakdown

- [ ] Surface paymaster-provider routes, authorizations, receipts, and recent sponsorship state in `openfox status`.
- [ ] Add paymaster-provider findings to `openfox health` and `openfox doctor`, especially for missing sponsor policy, expired sponsorship windows, or insufficient sponsor funding.
- [ ] Expose paymaster-provider service/operator state through the existing managed-service and service-status UX.
- [ ] Document the operator flow for requester, sponsor principal, and paymaster-provider roles.
- [ ] Add a multi-node example showing signer-provider plus paymaster-provider composition.
- [ ] Link paymaster-provider docs back into the roadmap and operator-facing guides so sponsored execution becomes part of the main runtime narrative.
