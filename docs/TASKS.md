# OpenFox Task Overview

This file tracks the runtime refactor priorities that should not get lost while
building OpenFox into a TOS-native agent platform.

## Current Priorities

- [x] Task 1: Rebuild the skills system around a repo-native skill catalog
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Move OpenFox away from inline default skills and direct skill
    instruction injection toward a bundled/managed/workspace skill snapshot model
    inspired by OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 2: Productize heartbeat, cron, and operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the always-on OpenFox runtime, but expose scheduling, status,
    wakeups, and operator controls in a cleaner product surface.
- [x] Task 3: Finish gateway and service operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the existing discovery/gateway protocol line, then improve
    deployment, health checks, service management, and operational examples.
- [x] Task 4: Add managed service install and lifecycle UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make OpenFox easier to run as an always-on user service with
    install/start/stop/restart/uninstall flows closer to OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 5: Add doctor and health diagnostics UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a one-command way to inspect config, wallet,
    inference, RPC, service state, and next-step repair guidance.
- [x] Task 6: Add model/provider status UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make provider readiness visible with an operator command similar to
    OpenClaw's model status surface, without expanding the provider matrix.
- [x] Task 7: Add onboarding command UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Provide an OpenClaw-style onboarding entrypoint that can initialize
    OpenFox and optionally install the managed service in one flow.
- [x] Task 8: Add logs operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a direct way to inspect recent OpenFox runtime logs
    without leaving the CLI.
- [x] Task 9: Add machine-readable runtime status surfaces
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Expose heartbeat, cron, service, gateway, and top-level runtime
    status as stable JSON snapshots for automation, dashboards, and future
    control plane integrations.
- [x] Task 10: Build the first bounty host/solver runtime slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn the bounty architecture into a working bounded-task loop with
    local judging, native payout, HTTP host endpoints, and automated solver
    flows.
- [x] Task 11: Generalize bounty into a task marketplace slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Move beyond a single question-only bounty and support multiple task
    kinds through one reusable engine, HTTP API, CLI surface, and skill-driven
    host/solver flow.
- [x] Task 12: Add non-question task skills
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add bundled task skills beyond the original question flow so OpenFox
    can host and solve translation, social proof, and third-party
    problem-solving work without changing the core engine.
- [x] Task 13: Add third-party problem solving, social bounty, and translation flows
  - Status: Complete

  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn the existing `observation.once` provider into a real paid
    service with stable request/result semantics, payment idempotency, and job
    retrieval instead of a one-off test payload flow.
- [x] Task 18: Launch the first paid oracle resolution service
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add a narrow paid oracle-style service on top of the same TOS-native
    runtime base without importing a full decentralized oracle protocol.
- [x] Task 19: Add standard settlement receipts and on-chain anchors

- Implementation direction:
  - Treat `zktls.bundle` as a Rust-first CLI worker backend.
  - Prefer the upstream `tlsn` Rust crates from TLSNotary as the first real
    backend candidate.
  - Do not treat `tlsn-js` or `tlsn-wasm` as the primary Node.js execution
    path for v1 backend integration.
  - Do not implement the real zkTLS engine as a Node.js/TypeScript in-process
    prover.
  - Keep OpenFox responsible for the provider shell only:
    payment, anti-replay, persistence, operator visibility, and backend
    selection.
  - Invoke the real backend through a bounded CLI worker contract using
    `stdin/stdout`, deterministic exit codes, and explicit timeout and size
    limits.

  - Prefer Rust verifier implementations that can consume TLSNotary-style
    attestation bundles and related verifier material as the first real backend
    class.
