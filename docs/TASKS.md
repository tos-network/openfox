# OpenFox Task Overview

This file tracks the runtime refactor priorities that should not get lost while
building OpenFox into a TOS-native agent platform.

## Current Priorities

- [x] Task 1: Rebuild the skills system around a repo-native skill catalog
  - Status: Complete

    instruction injection toward a bundled/managed/workspace skill snapshot model
    inspired by OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 2: Productize heartbeat, cron, and operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the always-on OpenFox runtime, but expose scheduling, status,
    wakeups, and operator controls in a cleaner product surface.
- [x] Task 3: Finish gateway and service operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Keep the existing discovery/gateway protocol line, then improve
    deployment, health checks, service management, and operational examples.
- [x] Task 4: Add managed service install and lifecycle UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make OpenFox easier to run as an always-on user service with
    install/start/stop/restart/uninstall flows closer to OpenClaw.
- [x] Task 5: Add doctor and health diagnostics UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a one-command way to inspect config, wallet,
    inference, RPC, service state, and next-step repair guidance.
- [x] Task 6: Add model/provider status UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Make provider readiness visible with an operator command similar to
    OpenClaw's model status surface, without expanding the provider matrix.
- [x] Task 7: Add onboarding command UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Provide an OpenClaw-style onboarding entrypoint that can initialize
    OpenFox and optionally install the managed service in one flow.
- [x] Task 8: Add logs operator UX
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give operators a direct way to inspect recent OpenFox runtime logs
    without leaving the CLI.
- [x] Task 9: Add machine-readable runtime status surfaces

    status as stable JSON snapshots for automation, dashboards, and future
    control plane integrations.
- [x] Task 10: Build the first bounty host/solver runtime slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Turn the bounty architecture into a working bounded-task loop with
    local judging, native payout, HTTP host endpoints, and automated solver
    flows.
- [x] Task 11: Generalize bounty into a task marketplace slice
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Move beyond a single question-only bounty and support multiple task
    kinds through one reusable engine, HTTP API, CLI surface, and skill-driven
    host/solver flow.
- [x] Task 12: Add non-question task skills
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Add bundled task skills beyond the original question flow so OpenFox
    can host and solve translation, social proof, and third-party
    problem-solving work without changing the core engine.
- [x] Task 13: Add third-party problem solving, social bounty, and translation flows
  - Status: Complete

- [x] Task 54: Publish ecosystem-facing `tosdk` example packs
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Give third-party builders direct requester/provider/network examples
    for the native SDK so they do not need to read OpenFox runtime internals
    before integrating.
- [x] Task 55: Add fleet manifest linting for public operator bundles

    tokens, and non-HTTPS public endpoints before operators run public-fleet
    actions against a bad manifest.
- [x] Task 56: Add dashboard bundle exports for public fleets
  - Status: Complete
  - Goal: Export one self-contained audit bundle with the manifest copy,
    dashboard JSON, dashboard HTML, and lint report instead of requiring
    operators to stitch those artifacts together manually.

  - max validation gas
  - max execution gas
  - max value
  - expiry
  - replay protection expectations
- [x] Define signer-type parity as a hard protocol requirement:
  - unified sponsor-aware native transactions must support the same `SignerType` set for both execution-side and sponsor-side authorization
  - this applies to both requester/execution signatures and sponsor/paymaster signatures
- [x] Define payment idempotency and payment-to-authorization binding rules for paymaster-provider flows.

- [x] Add `openfox paymaster ...` CLI surfaces for provider discovery, quote, authorize, and receipt lookup.
- [x] Surface requester-side and sponsor-side signer types in paymaster authorization objects and CLI output so operators can confirm signer-type parity in practice.
