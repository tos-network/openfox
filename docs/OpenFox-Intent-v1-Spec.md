# OpenFox Intent v1 Spec

Status: draft  
Audience: `gtos`, `tolang`, `tosdk`, and `OpenFox` implementers

## 1. Goal

This document defines the minimum concrete shape of Intent v1 for the current
stack.

The design choice for v1 is:

- keep one native transaction family in `gtos`
- add a first-class signed `IntentEnvelope`
- let solvers discover and quote intents off-chain
- settle a chosen fill through the ordinary native transaction path
- attach an `intent_auth` block to the fill transaction so `gtos` can validate
  the fill against the intent

This avoids introducing a second execution family while still making the
protocol intent-aware.

## 2. Non-Goals

Intent v1 does not attempt to provide:

- private orderflow by default
- encrypted intents
- cross-chain fill orchestration
- arbitrary on-chain satisfaction programs
- a universal auction protocol
- custom intent families for every application category

V1 only needs one canonical family:

- `ExecutionIntent`

## 3. Roles

- `principal`: the wallet or account contract whose objective is being executed
- `requester`: the runtime that authors and submits the intent, often `OpenFox`
- `solver`: the agent that computes a valid execution path and submits a fill
- `sponsor`: an optional fee payer or paymaster authority
- `watcher`: a runtime that observes intent state and fill outcomes

## 4. Canonical Objects

Intent v1 uses five canonical objects:

1. `ExecutionIntent`
2. `IntentEnvelope`
3. `IntentCancel`
4. `IntentAuth`
5. `IntentReceipt`

### 4.1 `ExecutionIntent`

`ExecutionIntent` is the unsigned semantic body.

Required fields:

## 6. Canonical Hashing and Signing

Intent v1 should use a canonical typed-binary sign payload, not ad hoc JSON
serialization.

Recommended rule:

- encode `ExecutionIntent` into a deterministic binary payload
- hash it with `keccak256`
- sign that hash with the same signer-type-aware framework already used by `gtos`

The `intent_hash` is:

```text
intent_hash = keccak256(EncodeExecutionIntent(intent))
```

The signed payload excludes:

- `signature`
- transport wrappers
- local quote metadata

The same signer-type support expected for native execution should also be
accepted for intent signatures.

## 7. Intent State Machine

The canonical state machine is:

```text
open -> filled
open -> partially_filled
open -> cancelled
open -> expired
partially_filled -> partially_filled
partially_filled -> filled
partially_filled -> cancelled
partially_filled -> expired
```

Invalid transitions must be rejected by the protocol.

## 8. Validation Rules in `gtos`

When a solver submits a fill transaction with `intent_auth`, `gtos` must verify:

1. the intent exists or is supplied in a protocol-accepted retrievable form
2. `chain_id` matches the local chain
3. the intent signature is valid
4. the intent is not expired
5. the intent is not cancelled
6. the intent has remaining fill capacity
7. the fill transaction targets the `target.surface_id` contract surface
8. the solver only changed parameters listed in `allowed_mutable_params`
9. realized input, output, fee, and gas values remain within hard bounds
10. sponsor usage matches `settlement.sponsor_mode`
11. the resulting fill does not overfill the intent

If any of these checks fail, the fill is rejected and the receipt reason code
should be explicit.

## 9. `tolang` ABI and Artifact Requirements

Intent v1 depends on `tolang` publishing a machine-readable `intent_surface`
object for each fillable surface.

Minimum fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Stable surface ID. |
| `entrypoint` | `string` | Function or entrypoint name. |
| `fill_mode` | `enum` | `quote_only`, `single_fill`, `partial_fill`. |
| `mutable_params` | `[]string` | Parameters the solver may choose. |
| `hard_bounds_schema` | `object` | Schema of bounds that must be checked. |
| `effects` | `[]string` | Effect summary already aligned with existing metadata. |
| `receipt_events` | `[]string` | Events that watchers use for confirmation. |
| `required_capabilities` | `[]string` | Optional principal or solver capability list. |

Suggested JSON shape inside `.toc`:

```json
{
  "intent_surfaces": [
    {
      "id": "swap.exact_in",
      "entrypoint": "swapExactIn",
      "fill_mode": "single_fill",
      "mutable_params": ["route", "solver_fee_bps"],
      "hard_bounds_schema": {

      },
      "effects": [
        "writes:balances[beneficiary]",
        "emits:SwapSettled(agent,u256,u256)"
      ],
      "receipt_events": ["SwapSettled"],
      "required_capabilities": []
    }
  ]
}
```

  "max_solver_fee_wei": "2000000000000000",
  "observed_outcome_hash": "0xbbbb...",
  "sponsor_auth": "0x"
}
```

## 13. OpenFox Runtime Expectations

`OpenFox` should use this spec in four modes:

- requester mode: author and submit intents
- solver mode: discover intents, simulate paths, and submit fills
- sponsor mode: issue bounded sponsorship authorizations for fills
- watcher mode: track intent states, receipts, solver performance, and failures

`OpenFox` quote records and internal solver heuristics are intentionally not part
of the protocol spec.

## 14. Recommended v1 Decision

For v1, the stack should explicitly choose:

- `IntentEnvelope` as the canonical off-chain intent object
- `intent_auth` as an extension block on the native transaction envelope
- `intent_surface` metadata in `tolang` artifacts
- `tos_sendIntent` / `tos_getIntent` / `tos_cancelIntent` / `tos_intentStatus`
  / `tos_estimateIntent` as the base RPC surface

That is the minimum coherent spec that upgrades the stack from transaction-native
delegated execution to intent-aware settlement without overbuilding the first
version.
