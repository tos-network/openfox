**While you sleep, Fox keeps working and brings the coins back.**

OpenFox is a continuously running AI agent runtime built to keep working in the background:

- watching for opportunities
- calling tools
- executing tasks
- handling payments
- settling work
- continuing to operate while you are away from the keyboard

The product goal is simple:

> You do not sit in front of AI and babysit it.  
> Fox goes out, does the work, and brings the coins back.

Here, "coins" is not just a slogan. It means real earning capacity:

- paid API revenue
- automation revenue
- agent service revenue
- oracle / observation / execution revenue
- future TOS-native agent economy revenue

## What OpenFox Is

OpenFox is a **local-first, wallet-native, payment-aware AI agent runtime**.

It is designed to run continuously, maintain its own state, use local and remote tools, manage wallets and payment flows, and optimize around long-lived value creation instead of single-turn chat.

OpenFox is meant to be:

- an agent that keeps running
- an agent that controls its own wallet
- an agent that can take work, execute, and settle
- an agent that can keep operating while you sleep

---

## The Problem We Are Solving

Most AI products today still work like this:

> a human clicks once, the model replies once

That is not how durable value is created in the real world.

Real value usually comes from:

- continuous observation
- repeated execution
- scheduled actions
- multi-step workflows
- payments and settlement
- reacting to external events without constant human supervision

So OpenFox is not primarily about making AI "more conversational".

It is about this:

**turn AI into an agent that keeps working.**

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Local-first runtime

OpenFox now runs locally by default and no longer requires Runtime in the main startup path.

It already supports these inference providers:

- `OpenAI`
- `Anthropic`
- `Ollama`

Once a provider is configured, Fox can start and keep running on your local machine.

### 2. Continuous execution loop

OpenFox is built around a continuous loop:

**Think -> Act -> Observe -> Repeat**

It can:

- read context
- decide what to do next
- call tools
- observe results
- keep advancing work over time

### 3. Wallet and payment support

OpenFox already has TOS wallet integration and can:

- derive TOS addresses
- query balances
- query nonces
- sign native TOS transfers
- send native TOS transactions

It also supports TOS `x402` payment flow, which is a key building block for paid agent services and paid APIs.

### 4. Background persistence

OpenFox includes heartbeat logic, scheduled tasks, and persistent local state, so it does not require constant terminal attention.

It can maintain:

- runtime state
- scheduling
- turn history
- skills
- tool call history
- wallet context
- task context

### 5. Agent Discovery and Gateway relay

OpenFox can already operate in three roles:

- requester
- provider
- gateway

It supports:

- signed Agent Cards
- capability discovery over GTOS Agent Discovery
- sponsored capabilities such as `sponsor.topup.testnet`
- paid capabilities such as `observation.once`
- gateway-backed provider endpoints for agents behind NAT

The Gateway v1 path is:

- gateway agents advertise `gateway.relay`
- providers open outbound WebSocket sessions to a gateway
- the gateway allocates public relay URLs
- the provider republishes those relay URLs in its Agent Card

That means an OpenFox instance without a public IP can still provide an externally reachable capability through a gateway agent.

### 6. Extensible agent surface

OpenFox supports:

- skills
- custom tools
- local file and shell operations
- task orchestration
- worker / child-agent paths

That makes it an extensible agent runtime rather than a fixed-purpose application.

---

## Product Direction

OpenFox is not trying to be "another AI chat app".

It is trying to become:

**an AI agent runtime that can work and earn automatically.**

The shortest description is:

> OpenFox is the fox that keeps working on your machine.  
> While you sleep, it keeps watching, executing, and bringing the coins back.

The near-term product direction includes:

- paid API agents
- paid observation agents
- oracle / resolution agents
- automation agents
- on-chain and off-chain settlement
- TOS-native agent economy

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tos-network/openfox
cd openfox
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js --run
```

On first run, OpenFox launches an interactive setup wizard that:

- creates a local wallet
- initializes the local config directory
- asks for the agent name
- asks for the genesis prompt
- asks for the creator address
- configures the inference provider

The local state directory is currently:

```bash
~/.openfox/
```

That path is still inherited from the earlier runtime and can be renamed later.

---

## Configure Inference

OpenFox now supports a provider-first configuration model.

You need at least one inference provider configured.

### OpenAI

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

### Anthropic

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

### Ollama

```bash
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

Provider settings live in:

```bash
~/.openfox/openfox.json
```

## Agent Gateway Example

The minimal gateway setup uses one public OpenFox as a gateway agent and one private OpenFox as a provider.

Gateway agent:

```json
{
  "agentDiscovery": {
    "enabled": true,
    "publishCard": true,
    "gatewayServer": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bindHost": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 4880,
      "sessionPath": "/agent-gateway/session",
      "publicPathPrefix": "/a",
      "publicBaseUrl": "https://gw.example.com",
      "capability": "gateway.relay",
      "mode": "sponsored",
      "priceModel": "sponsored"
    }
  }
}
```

Provider behind NAT:

```json
{
  "agentDiscovery": {
    "enabled": true,
    "publishCard": true,
    "faucetServer": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "gatewayClient": {
      "enabled": true,
      "gatewayBootnodes": [
        {
          "agentId": "0xGatewayAgentId",
          "url": "wss://gw.example.com/agent-gateway/session"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

When a provider finds a `gateway.relay` agent through discovery, it will prefer that route. If none is discoverable yet, it falls back to `gatewayBootnodes`.

You can still express provider settings using a nested provider/model structure
inside the OpenFox config file. Example:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
      }
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "anthropic": {
        "apiKey": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## TOS Integration

OpenFox already includes the TOS wallet and payment path needed for agent monetization.

Current support includes:

- TOS address derivation
- TOS balance queries
- TOS nonce queries
- native TOS transfer signing
- native TOS transfer sending
- TOS `x402` exact payment selection and payment flow

CLI examples:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/index.js tos-status
node packages/cli/dist/index.js tos-send 0x... 0.01
```

This matters because an earning agent cannot just think. It must also be able to:

- hold a wallet
- make payments
- receive payments
- connect to paid services

---

## Running OpenFox

Show help:

```bash
node dist/index.js --help
```

Start the runtime:

```bash
node dist/index.js --run
```

Reconfigure:

```bash
node dist/index.js --setup
node dist/index.js --configure
node dist/index.js --pick-model
```

---

## What OpenFox Is Good For

OpenFox is especially well suited to long-running background tasks such as:

- scheduled observation and summarization
- event monitoring and triggering
- paid API calls with structured delivery
- wallet-aware on-chain workflows
- small automated work pipelines
- persistent personal agents

The longer-term fit is even stronger for:

- oracle agents
- paid observation jobs
- task marketplace agents
- TOS-native agent services

## Current Status

OpenFox has already completed several key transitions:

- from Runtime-first to local-first startup
- support for OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama provider configuration
- support for OpenFox-native provider config in `~/.openfox/openfox.json`
- support for TOS wallet and TOS `x402`
- operation as a continuously running agent runtime

Still in progress:

- full OpenFox naming cleanup across the repository
- richer paid service layers
- TOS-native earning markets
- production-grade monetization flow for autonomous agents

---

## Vision

We do not define OpenFox as "an AI that chats".

We define it as:

**an AI agent that keeps working, keeps settling payments, and keeps bringing value back on its own.**

The end state we want is simple:

> While you sleep, Fox keeps working.  
> When you wake up, it has already brought the coins back.
